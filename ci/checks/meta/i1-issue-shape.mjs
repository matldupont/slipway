// I1 — issue shape.
//
// Reads every *.md in the given directory as an issue body, as GitHub renders an issue
// form: each field becomes `### <label>`, an empty field `_No response_`. An issue made
// with `gh issue create` and free prose has no fields at all, and fails — the web form
// enforces shape; this is what catches the API path.
//
//   acceptance/missing          no acceptance criteria
//   ac/unfalsifiable/<n>        item n has no number, no `code`, no comparison, does not
//                               start with Given/When/Then, and has no #ref — an adjective
//   seams/unanswered            person, channel or promise? not answered; silence is not `none`
//   seams/none-without-reason   `none` with no reason
//   seams/unenumerated          a person, channel or promise with no detail
//   contract/missing            Links says Lane: feature, no Contract section
//   contract/link-only          Contract has fewer than 8 non-link words — nothing copied in
//   verify/missing              Links says Lane: feature, no Verify section
//   verify/link-only            Verify has fewer than 8 non-link words — nothing copied in
//
// WHY: an issue whose acceptance criteria cannot fail closes, then reopens. A conditional
// rule — "answer seams whenever the feature adds a person…" — makes an absent section
// indistinguishable from correct non-application, so in practice it is skipped. Here the
// question is always asked.
//
// A feature-lane issue must carry its feature doc's Contract and Verify copied in, never
// linked (`process/intake.md` → Issue body): the issue is built from its own body.
// "Link-only" is a word count, not a regex over the whole section: split on whitespace, drop
// any token that is a URL or a markdown link/reference (`://`, or starts `[` or `<http`), and
// if fewer than 8 words remain, the section named a doc instead of embedding it. This also
// catches a Contract that is just thin — a real one is never seven words — and it is O(n):
// no backtracking, no cap on link length to get wrong. A section that embeds real content and
// also links the doc passes — the rule is about what's missing, not about citing a source.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION: this counts words, not meaning. Eight words of filler in front of a link
// ("Please go read the linked document over here: [doc](url)") clears the floor and passes.
// I1 catches the honest mistake of linking instead of embedding; it is not a defense against
// someone gaming it on purpose — that is cold review's job, not a static check's. See
// `ci/fixtures/known-bad/i1/feature-padded-link.md`, kept passing on purpose so the gap is
// documented, not hidden.
//
// RESIDUAL, stated so green is not over-read: this catches adjectives ("lower contrast"),
// not criteria that cannot fail. "Returns HTTP 200" passes. That class belongs to cold
// review.
