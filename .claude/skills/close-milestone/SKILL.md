description: Close (or kill) the active milestone — verify its gate with evidence, write an evidence-based retro, close the GitHub milestone, mark shipped feature docs, file lessons, and set up the next bet. Use at step 6 of SLIPWAY.md, when a milestone's gate is green, when its appetite has ended (`pnpm status` says "circuit breaker"), or when the user says "close M2", "wrap up the milestone", "kill this milestone".

# Close milestone

Step 6 of the slipway path (`SLIPWAY.md`). A milestone ends one of three ways — **closed** (gate green), **killed** (kill
criteria met, or not worth more time), or **extended** (a recorded decision, the exception). An
open milestone nobody is working on is not one of them.

Start with `pnpm status`; the active milestone is the one it names. Read that milestone file,
`docs/milestones/TEMPLATE.md` (Retro expectations), and the issues in its GitHub milestone:

```bash
gh issue list --milestone "<title>" --state all --json number,title,state,closedAt,labels --limit 200
```

## 1. Decide which ending

- Gate evidence exists → **close**.
- Appetite over, gate not green → ask the user: cut the remaining slices and close with what
  shipped, kill, or extend. **Extending needs a `decisions.md` entry** (why, new last day, what
  was cut to fit) and `extended: D-nnn` in the milestone frontmatter. Recommend cutting; that
  is the default the appetite exists to enforce.
- Kill criteria observed → **kill**. Not a failure: the milestone did its job.

## 2. Prove the gate

For every line under `## Gate`, produce the evidence: run the check or test, link the CI run,
quote the metric with its date. Paste the output. A gate line you cannot evidence means the
milestone is not closed — say so. Anything not verified (motion, real devices, production
data) is listed as not verified, not waved through (L-36).

## 3. Write the retro — from the record, not memory

Fill `## Retro` in the milestone file:

- **Planned vs shipped.** Each Contents slice: shipped (PR links), cut (where it went), or
  changed (how).
- **Scope that crept in.** Issues or PRs in the milestone that no slice planned. For each: was
  it necessary?
- **Rework.** PRs that reverted or re-did earlier PRs in this milestone (`git log --oneline
  <first-sha>..HEAD`, look for revert, fix-of-fix, follow-ups merged the same day). Name the
  cause.
- **Appetite.** Planned days vs actual.
- **Code health.** Each ratchet in `ci/baselines.json` (dead code, duplication) at the start and end
  of the milestone, from `git log -p ci/baselines.json`. A number that went up means a baseline was
  raised: name the decision that did it. Consolidation work goes in the cool-down, not the next bet.
- **Lessons.** Anything that cost real time and could recur becomes a file in
  `process/lessons/` with an honest enforcement status and a project id, `PL-<n>` (L1 checks it). Search existing lessons
  first; extend one rather than duplicating it.

Keep it to one screen. Opinions about quality go in lessons, not the retro.

## 4. Update the record

1. Milestone frontmatter: `status: closed` (or `killed`).
2. Each feature doc the milestone shipped: `status: shipped`, and a fresh
   `Verified against: <main sha> <date>`. Behaviour that differs from its Contract becomes a
   `## Changes` line, not a rewrite.
3. Open issues still in the GitHub milestone: move each to the next milestone, to a declined
   lesson with a trigger, or close it with a reason. Then close the GitHub milestone:
   `gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/<number> -f state=closed`.
4. PRD: shipped features and resolved OD- entries updated; bump `Version:` if anything
   substantive changed (reviews pin it, R1).

## 5. Next bet

Show the user the shaping milestones and, after launch, the latest `docs/product/metrics.md`
weekly review. Recommend one next bet with the evidence for it. Before launch the default is
the next milestone in order; after launch it is whatever moves activation or retention for the
users who would be most disappointed to lose the product. Do not activate it: the user sets
its appetite dates and `status: active`.

Finish with `pnpm meta` (MS1 must be green) and `pnpm status`, pasted, on a branch with a PR.
